# CRM System

## Sales statuses

#### New opportunity:

- You identify a new lead and his or her contact information is recorded. How do you get these new leads? Through a variety of different lead generation activities, like webinars, ads, or content marketing.

#### Contacting:

- It’s time for one of the most challenging parts of the sales process: actually getting in touch with the lead. The prospect remains in this stage until you make contact.

#### Engaging:

- By this stage, you have talked to the prospect to determine whether he or she is qualified to make a purchase.

#### Qualified:

- This is the point where you need to decide whether the lead is qualified, meaning that he or she has the need, budget, and authority to make a purchase.

#### Custom stages:

- Somes businesses have unique sales stages, like scheduling in-person meetings or offering a free trial. Regardless of the tactic, this stage is designed to move the prospect closer to making a purchase.

#### Closing:

- As the sales process comes to an end, you ask the prospect to finalize the deal.

#### Won/Lost:

- All the stages come down to this final moment: whether the deal was a win or loss. Both results can prompt a set of subsequent actions, like a series of onboarding emails for new customers or a six-month check-in email for leads who didn’t end up buying.

## Sales Pipeline Metrics

How do you know if your sales pipeline is healthy? Here are five metrics to track:

#### Win rate

- is the percentage of leads that convert to actual sales. By monitoring win rate at each stage of your pipeline, you’ll understand where you excel and where prospect most often drop off.

#### Sales cycle

- length is the amount of time it takes for a lead to move from initial contact to a sale. If your team takes too long to move leads through the pipeline, you risk losing opportunities.

#### Deal fallout by phase

- refers to the predictable percentage of deals that drops off at every step of the pipeline. It’s important to understand why these deals fall through and to monitor this number — a big spike will impact your numbers for the following two or three quarters.

#### Lead response time

- is the amount of time it takes to contact or act on a new lead. This number is also a good indication of the health of your sales team. Are lead response times getting longer? Perhaps you need to grow your sales team.

#### Close ratio:

- is the number of closed sales as a percentage of total sales presentations made. You can use this to evaluate sales performance, industry trends, pricing, and your value proposition. For example, if leads fall off in the final stages of the pipeline, this could point to some problems with the product or pricing structure.
